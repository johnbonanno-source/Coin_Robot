# Coin_Robot
This coin robot follows the most optimal path in the maze in order to collect the most coins!


I decided to include this project in my portfolio because it is just a little code, to solve very big and complex problems; up to a 50 x 50 maze. I remember working on this code alone (CS 3) and being so proud of how quickly I was able to solve this programming challenge. I also did enjoy using the backtracking technique to find the most optimal path in the maze. I thought that it was such an elegant solution to searching problems. I wanted this program in my portfolio to demonstrate concise and highly technical programming. 

I thought that this program definitely demonstrated problem solving (CS 4) and critical thinking(CW 1) in terms of attacking a problem with a seemingly impossible solution. With some deliberation and thinking about the problem from a high level standpoint, I was able to solve a maze with just a little code. I also thought that this code demonstrated searching through, and also populating 2D arrays in a complex way. I do think that this sort of programming is important to learn and I look forward to improving on solving this sort of problem in the future.
